This module was created for UNOSAT's assistance to the international relief agency <A HREF="http://www.acted.org">ACTED</a>, in mapping agricultural areas of the Raymah division of Yemen to help improve water use. 
<br><br>
Much of this work has been done with satellite imagery, but photographs or videos of agricultural areas and practices in or near the Raymah division of Yemen were also valuable. 
<br><br>
Right now this project has few images, so if you have seen relevant media, you can <A HREF="http://geotagx.org/find_photos">use the Geotag-X firefox plugin</A> to share relevant media. 
<br><br>
Local knowledge of Raymah is valuable for geotagging this module. 
<br><br>
Media about coffee or qat (also spelt khat) crops in the area are particularly relevant, as well as any assessment of soil conditions or drought stress. This PDF <a href="http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/REACH_coffee_value_chain_assessment_in_Raymah_governorate_Yemen.pdf"> report about coffee production</a> is a related researc outcome.
