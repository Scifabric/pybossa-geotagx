This module is for geotagging photos associated with monsoonal floods from New Delhi’s Yamuna River. Local knowledge of New Delhi is useful for this module.
<br>
 If you can only give a rough estimate of where a photo is, that is still valuable. Just circle the area you think and move onto the next one. 
<br>
If it is not possible to geotag the photo, don't worry! Just click ‘don't know’ then save your answer, it is still valid and useful.
