GeoTag-X is an open-source, crowdsourcing project, for generating information from media about disasters. It is part of <a href="http://http://citizencyberlab.eu/">Citizen Cyberlab</a>, built with <a href=”http://pybossa.com/”>PyBossa</a> and hosted by <a href="http://www.unitar.org/unosat/">UNOSAT</a>.
<br><br>
The name GeoTag-X was chosen as it expresses key components of the system:
<ol>
<li>Geo: all media should be georeferenced as accurately as possible;</li>
<li>Tag: all media should have data tags relevant to the humanitarian and disaster response community, compatible with existing disaster response methodologies;</li>
<li>X: the system should be adaptable for diverse disaster situations anywhere. For example a flood in Bangladesh can occur at the same time as a flood in Sudan and we want GeoTag-X modules to support humanitarian responses for each event.</li>
</ol>

Test modules open for participation now (from mid-2014) but are experimental; we welcome volunteers and we encourage you to report bugs and suggest enhancements on <a href=”https://github.com/geotagx/pybossa/issues”>GitHub</a>, share feedback <a href="mailto:cobi.smith@unitar.org?Subject=geotagx">
via email</a> or <a href="http://citizencyberlab.eu/portfolio-type/events/">participate in a live event</a>. GeoTag-X involves collaborative learning and developing a community practice. New collaborations are welcome, as well as new individual participants. <br><br>

During disasters, first responders and emergency services deal with massive amounts of data. Disasters include sudden events such as earthquakes, floods, and hurricanes, as well as long-term events such as drought, climate change and pollution. Crowdsourcing has already been used during disaster events to help filter, categorise, and map data and has <a href=”https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wut8oDRo9BYSlc0hQ34Ng8qQ-pLVGlRO95WOvR3MN78/edit?hl=en_US”>proved invaluable</a>, though <a href=”http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/clay.westrope-28042014-065633-PHL_OSM-Damage-Assessment_Final-Report_To-submit.pdf”>challenges remain</a>. This is why GeoTag-X is a <a href=”http://citizencyberlab.eu/research/publications-and-reports/”>research project</a>, as well as a humanitarian technology project.
